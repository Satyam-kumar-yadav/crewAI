# Recursive Critiquing and Iterative Synthesis (RCI) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Recursive Critiquing and Iterative Synthesis (RCI) process using the `crewai` library. The RCI process is a technique for improving the quality of language model outputs by iteratively critiquing and refining the output based on the provided critique.

## Running Examples
To run the examples, execute the following command:
`python3 src/base_test.py`

## Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute the following command:
`python3 src/test_rci.py`

## Critique, Validate, and Improve Task Outputs

This project includes functionalities for critiquing, validating, and improving task outputs using a Language Model (LLM). These functionalities are essential for refining automated outputs and ensuring quality in task completion processes.

### Critique Method

The `critique` method evaluates the output generated by an LLM model against a given task description. It identifies logical or factual inaccuracies without rewriting the output.

### Validate Method

The `validate` method assesses critiques provided to task outputs and determines if significant changes are required. It outputs 'True' or 'False' based on the severity of identified issues.

### Improve Method

The `improve` method enhances task outputs based on critiques without adding explanations or preambles. It directly rewrites the output to address identified issues.

### Execute Method

The `_execute` method orchestrates the entire process by executing tasks, applying critiques, validating the output, and iterating to improve the output as needed.

For detailed implementation and usage, refer to the source code in [task.py](src/crewai/task.py) and the methods `critique`, `validate`, `improve`, and `_execute`.
